Title: YOLOv8 Object Detection Notebook

Description:

This repository contains a Colab notebook that demonstrates object detection using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once). YOLOv8 is one of the most advanced deep learning models for real-time object detection. This notebook includes:

Instructions to perform object detection on images or video.

A demo of how to train YOLOv8 on custom datasets.

Real-time object tracking with the model.

Example of detecting multiple objects such as cars, people, etc.

This project aims to provide a practical and simple implementation of YOLOv8 for anyone interested in learning or deploying object detection in real-time video streams.

Features:

Real-time object detection on videos and images

Easy-to-understand code and comments

Pre-trained YOLOv8 models for quick testing

Example code to run YOLOv8 on custom datasets
